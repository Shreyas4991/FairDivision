# Fair Division Theory in Lean

In this repository I formalise the theory of fair division in lean. The field can be broadly split into Discrete and Continuous fair division, whennce the folder structure.

### Moonshot Goals

A moonshot goal is to accumulate enough results to prove or disprove the existence of EFX allocations in discrete fair division theory.

### Proximate Goals

- Add the theory of envy-free allocations of goods
- Add continuous cake cutting algorithms, both exact and approximate
- Add results about EFX allocations and EEFX allocations which are known so far
